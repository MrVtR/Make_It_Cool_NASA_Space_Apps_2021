# Make_It_Cool_NASA_Space_Apps_2021

## Project concept
This project consists of performing the NASA Space Apps Marathon 2021 challenge, our team's theme is [Waring: Things Are Heating Up](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/warning-things-are-heating-up/teams/make-it-cool/project), we use ReactJS to perform the project, along with the help of libraries that will be listed below <br/>
The site created has Six main tabs planned:
1. **Home** - Page designed to show how the team met, what our goals are as a team, and what projects we did within the solution to the NAS challenge. The project's homepage, where we present our concerns regarding the natural disasters that occur around the world, along with the solutions we proposed, highlighting the Predictive Model on Temperature Rises, the game we developed, and a sample of historical data via Map
2. **About Us** - Page designed to show how the team met, what our goals were as a team, and what projects we did within the solution to the NASA challenge
3. **Map** - Page with the function of displaying the results of our Predictive solutions, which show future predictions for the city of São Paulo - Brazil regarding temperature increases, in addition, we also developed a sample of historical data (1990-2021) from the NASA EONET base, helping to show the user what impacts his region had over time, highlighting the sample results, using the colors Green, Yellow and Red to sample the results in the format of Heat Waves, finally, we inform the user about the main problems we work within the challenge, along with their origins and consequences, such as the high rate of fires and heat stress
4. **Learn** - On this page we present Mitigations that the user can follow on an individual basis, and we also inform what responsibility the government should have to contribute to reducing disaster rates. In addition, we also inform you about the origins and consequences of other natural disasters that have not been explicitly addressed within our data analysis, such as Oceans, Air Pollution and Agricultural Damage.
5. **Game** - For this page we made, the intention of it is to present the game developed by the team within the GDevelop5 Engine, this game has the objective of making people aware of themes such as: Pollution, Conscious Voting, Food Waste, Fashion World and Green Certificates, the user can play in a simple and fast way within the browser itself. In addition, we explain the above-mentioned topics in depth in sections further down in the game run
6. **To Inspire** - This is a section for the user to feel welcomed by our challenge and be encouraged to collaborate in any way they can, because all help matters when it comes to our Planet, so we present some suggestions for the reader to put into practice, and to mention our team in ecological situations in the future within their social networks

## Prerequisites and resources used
For the project to be realized, the following dependencies for ReactJS were used:
1. [ReactJS: 0.17.1](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases)
2. [React-router-dom: 5.2.0](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
3. [Node Sass: 4.14.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass/v/4.14.1)
4. [Axios: 0.21.1](https://github.com/axios/axios)
6. [react-elastic-carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-elastic-carousel)
7. [mapboxgl](https://www.mapbox.com)
8. [https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder](https://github.com/jonathandion/react-tilt)
  
## Step by step
1. The team of 6 people met during 10/02/2021 and 10/03/2021, for 48 hours we collected data from NASA to feed our application
2. I created the project and mapped the routes through React-router-dom, and configured the API requests with Axios
3. I created the common components that could be used in the whole project
4. I researched the libraries that use geolocation to be included inside our site
5. During the middle of the competition, we finalized a game to make people aware of their actions by including it within the web application
6. Finally, we did predictive analysis on the increase of temperatures within our country, so that it may be possible to alert the population and suggest practices that decrease damage to their physiological systems
